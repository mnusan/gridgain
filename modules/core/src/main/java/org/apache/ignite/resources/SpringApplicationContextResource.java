 * Spring Application Context can be injected into instances of following classes:
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@link org.apache.ignite.compute.ComputeTask}</li>
 * <li>{@link org.apache.ignite.compute.ComputeJob}</li>
 * <li>{@link org.apache.ignite.spi.IgniteSpi}</li>

 * <pre name="code" class="java">
 * public class MyGridJob implements ComputeJob {
 *      ...
 *      &#64;SpringApplicationContextResource
 *      private ApplicationContext springCtx;
